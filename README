Godo is a simple todo app. Meant to help you track what you have to do and stop
worrying about organizing what you have to do. Greatly inspired by Steve Losh's
`t`, as such, you can read the README for `t` and a lot of stuff will apply to
Godo as well.

Godo has no big organizing features, for these just distract you and don't let
you get to what you really need to do.
