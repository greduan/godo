# Godo

<!-- BADGES http://shields.io/ -->

Godo is a simple todo app. Meant to help you track what you have to do and stop
worrying about organizing what you have to do. Greatly inspired by [Steve Losh's
t](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/t/), as such, you can read the README for t and
a lot of stuff will apply to Godo as well.

Godo has no big organizing features, for these just distract you and don't let
you get to what you really need to do.

Godo does contain features though, these are:

- Todo tasks tracking.
- Basic tags support.
- "To be finished by..." sort of feature.

For advanced users who insist on organizing their todo lists there is a special
feature. Godo supports trees of todos. So you can have several sub-items for
each todo, making them sub-tasks or just allowing you to use a "big name" under
which to put your todo tasks.

If it applies, a GIF is worth a thousand words. You can use this as a guideline
