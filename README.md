# Godo
[![Greduan Gittip](http://img.shields.io/gittip/Greduan.svg)](https://www.gittip.com/Greduan/)

Godo is a simple todo app. Meant to help you track what you have to do and stop
worrying about organizing what you have to do. Greatly inspired by [Steve Losh's
t](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/t/), as such, you can read the README for t and
a lot of stuff will apply to Godo as well.

Godo has no big organizing features, for these just distract you and don't let
you get to what you really need to do.


## Installation

You can get the latest stable version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Greduan/godo), if you want the latest dev version
you'll have to go to [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/Greduan/godo).

More detailed instructions on installing coming soon, maybe.

### Why both GitHub and Bitbucket?

This is because I prefer Mercurial over Git but GitHub is still superior over
BitBucket for sharing, so I use what I prefer while developing and I use GitHub
to distribute the releases.

However, the issue tracking still happens at GitHub, because, again, GitHub is
still superior to BitBucket in this regard. And oh my gosh are GitHub issues
awesome.


## Known Bugs

There are no known (major) bugs for now.
If you find something that seems like a bug or undesirable behaviour or results,
just open a [new issue](https://github.com/Greduan/$REPO/issues/new) with your
OS and the version of the software that you are using. Also please include what
you expected to happen and what actually happened.

If it applies, a GIF is worth a thousand words. You can use this as a guideline
if you're on *nix systems (like you should be): [Use GIFs in your Pull Request
for Good, not
Evil](http://www.schneems.com/post/41104255619/use-gifs-in-your-pull-request-for-good-not-evil/)
